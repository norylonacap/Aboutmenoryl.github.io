                One of my hobbies is taking photographs of nature, as I find
                great fulfillment in capturing landscapes, wildlife, and the
                intricate details that highlight the beauty of the natural
                environment.

                One of the works I created was a user interface (UI) project in
                our subject, Principles of Accounting, where I utilized HTML and
                CSS to design and develop a functional layout that demonstrates
                both technical skills in web development and an understanding of
                accounting concepts.

                One of my skills is drawing, which I began to develop during my
                elementary years. At that time, my parents and family members
                recognized my potential in this area; however, I did not pursue
                opportunities to further refine or enhance this skill as I grew
                older.

              <h2>Info. About Me</h2>
              <p>
                Hello, my name is Lyron Dave M. Pacano. I was born on February
                5, 2005, and I am currently 20 years old. I am both the first
                and the last son in my family, which means that I am an only
                child. I grew up and currently reside in Duplas, San Juan, La
                Union, where I have spent most of my life building my
                experiences, values, and aspirations.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am currently a college student at Don Mariano Marcos Memorial
                State University (DMMMSU), pursuing a degree under the College
                of Information Technology (CIT). The course I have chosen allows
                me to gain knowledge and skills in various areas of technology,
                programming, and systems development. At present, I am in my
                third year of study, continuing to explore my field of interest
                and preparing myself for future opportunities in the IT
                industry.
